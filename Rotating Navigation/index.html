          Bugatti states that the Tourbillon is a completely new design, and
          does not share any components with the outgoing Chiron, but in keeping
          with the Bugatti brand lineage, it does share many of its key design
          cues, including the horseshoe grille, central spine, C-shaped side
          body lines, and two-tone body colour. One of the stated inspirations
          for the Tourbillon was mechanical watches, with the car containing a
          fully analog center console operated by mechanical gears, designed to
          look like a watch movement, while the speedometer and tachometer
          needles were arranged to resemble an hour and minute hand.[6] Another
          design theme of the Tourbillon is a "skeletonized" mechanical design,
          where the mechanisms of components are made visible as a part of the
          design.

          The interior of the Tourbillon features a steering wheel with a fixed
          central hub where only the outer rim rotates, allowing the instrument
          cluster to remain visible at all times. It also features an
          infotainment screen that retracts into the dashboard when not in use.
          Bugatti says that, as in past models, their goal was to make sure that
          the car remains "timeless", even when the screen technology inevitably
          becomes outdated. The center panel of the Tourbillon is made from
          machined aluminum and machined crystal glass, while the watch-inspired
          instrument cluster is made from titanium by Swiss watchmaker
          Concepto.[7]
